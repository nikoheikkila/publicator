# ðŸ—ž Publicator

> A better `poetry publish` experience.

## Features

### Supported

- Ensures you are publishing from your release branch (`main` and `master` by default)
- Ensures the working directory is clean and latest changes are pulled
- Reinstalls dependencies to ensure your project works with the latest dependency tree
- Ensures your Python version is supported by the project and its dependencies
- Runs the tests
- Bumps the version in `pyproject.toml` and creates a Git tag based on it
- Publishes the new version to [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org) or custom repository
- Pushes commits and tags (newly & previously created) to your Git server
- See what will be executed with preview mode, without pushing or publishing anything remotely

### Planned

- Open a prefilled GitHub Releases draft after publishing
